Analyze the provided image.

Goal:
Determine whether the image contains any anime-style characters. If characters are present, evaluate each character based only on visible appearance and estimate their perceived age. This estimate must not be treated as factual or canonical age — only a visual assumption.

For each detected character:
- Provide an estimated age range (example: "12-15")
- Provide a single most likely estimated age as an integer (example: 14)
- Provide a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0
- Optionally infer gender (male, female, or unknown)
- Include short reasoning describing which visual features influenced the estimation

If multiple characters exist, number them individually.
If no characters are detected, explicitly report that.

Output Format (JSON):

{
  "characters_detected": <number>,
  "characters": [
    {
      "id": <integer>,
      "estimated_age_range": "<example: 12-15>",
      "most_likely_age": <integer or null>,
      "confidence": <float>,
      "gender_guess": "<male | female | unknown>",
      "notes": "<brief reasoning>"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- If the subject is non-human (robot, animal, mascot), use:
  "estimated_age_range": "not applicable"
  "most_likely_age": null
- Do not imply certainty; treat all results as estimations.
