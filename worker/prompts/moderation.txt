## Response Format
Output only: [[0]], [[1]], [[2]], [[3]], [[4]], [[5]], [[6]], [[7]], [[8]], [[9]], or [[10]]
No explanations or additional text.

## Additional Guidelines
- When uncertain between two levels, choose the higher rating for safety
- Consider context, intent, and artistic merit
- Focus on what is implied or suggested through non-visual means
- Exposure of socially acceptable body parts (face, cheeks, ears, hands, arms, lower legs, feet, neck) should NOT be considered sexual exposure regardless of context
- Only exposure of typically covered body parts (chest/breasts, buttocks, genitals, upper thighs, midriff in certain contexts) should be evaluated for sexual content
